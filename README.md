Developed a match-3 mobile game with Unity Game Engine and published it on the play store with features including a slot machine, virtual currency, in-app purchases, and time-based rewards. It received more than 1000 downloads from all over the world and achieved 4+ reviews from so many players. Along with this development, I gained two years of Unity and C# experience.
